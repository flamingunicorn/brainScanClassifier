# Project Desription - brainScanClassifier
## This image classifier is built with TensorFlow and aims to identify neurological conditions using brain scan images sourced from studies available on the [IDAs](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp) website. Currently, the classifier focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease, autism, or neither condition. The ultimate goal is to expand its capabilities by incorporating more neurological diseases and conditions into the classifier's repertoire.
